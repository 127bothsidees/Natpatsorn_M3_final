							<h2>Playing Games</h2>
							<h4>Playing game is a great hobby for me because it's a fun and engaging way to de-stress and completely zone out from daily life. It provides an immersive escape that helps me recharge mentally and emotionally. Beyond entertainment, gaming can also boost cognitive skills like focus and problem-solving, offering a satisfying sense of accomplishment.<br><br>I personally love simulation, indie, and cozy games because they offer a fantastic escape from high-stress action, prioritizing a relaxed and creative pace. Simulation titles appeal to me by providing a sense of calm control through the gentle mastery of real-life tasks or environments, while indie and cozy games foster creativity and exploration in a low-pressure setting. A perfect example of this relaxing appeal is Potion Craft, where I can immerse myself in the satisfying, detailed process of alchemy, mixing ingredients, and running a shop. It beautifully combines a creative, cozy vibe with a thoughtful simulation experience.</h4>

							<h2>Why and How long have I been enjoyed it</h2>
							<h4>✧ Why do I like to play games?<br>People often talk about how video games have been a big part of their lives for years. That holds true for me too. As a generation that grows up with technology, I have spent a lot of time with all sorts of games over the years. Lately though, I find myself drawn more to cozy ones. These are the relaxing sorts that do not stress you out much. Think Potion Craft, for example. I will get into that one soon. They match up nicely with my style of playing. I like to take it calm and creative. No real pressure involved. That setup just makes everything feel nice and fun. So I end up going back to them over and over.</h4>
							<h4>✧ How long have I been playing games?<br>Gaming appeals to me in a straightforward way. It fills up spare moments and offers something worthwhile. Pretty much like what draws in other players. Entertainment comes first. Then there is the good feeling from making progress. Plus it lets me unwind after a long day. Over time, this has turned into more than a simple hobby for me. It serves as a path to relaxation. I can explore creative sides there too. And it pulls me away from the usual daily pressures.</h4>

							<h2>My Favorite Game</h2>
							<h4>In the independent single-player simulation game Potion Craft, you manage a medieval alchemist shop, manually grind and combine ingredients to make potions, and sell them to clients on a daily basis. A charming and rustic medieval fantasy feel permeates the entire game thanks to the hand-drawn art style, which is reminiscent of old woodcuts and parchments with gentle, natural colors. The music features serene, medieval-inspired background tracks that support a laid-back, workshop atmosphere without being overpowering, and the sound effects, such as the crunch of roots, the bubbling of your cauldron, and the soft clinks of tools, are expertly designed to make every potion-making action feel tactile and immersive.</h4>
