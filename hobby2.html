				<h2>Watching Series</h2>
				<h4>I absolutely love watching series because it's my perfect strategy for unwinding and genuinely stepping away from the daily stress and pressures that build up. While I'm open to dramas from all over East Asia—I definitely enjoy shows from Thailand, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan—I've recently become completely hooked on Chinese dramas. They offer this wonderful, comforting escape thanks to their deeply rich storylines, significant emotional resonance, and that distinct cultural atmosphere which is just so captivating. It's truly a reliable way for me to relax and feel recharged after a particularly demanding or busy day. <br><br> Ultimately, viewing these shows is so much more than just a form of entertainment; it’s an essential practice for mental and emotional renewal. It helps me gain fresh perspectives, sparks my imagination, and provides those peaceful moments of reflection that let me completely reset. Once the credits roll on a truly great series, I often feel inspired, thoughtful, and fully read</h4>

				<h2>What makes me into watching series</h2>
				<h4>My interest in watching series began casually, evolving from watching regular TV dramas to occasionally browsing shows on Netflix without much commitment. Everything changed, however, in early high school when I discovered a Chinese costume drama; its compelling historical setting, plot, and charismatic cast instantly captivated me and sparked a genuine passion for the genre. Since then, I’ve steadily followed my favorite actors and accumulated a long list of adored Chinese dramas, making it my ultimate go-to activity—it’s not just passing the time, but my personal, happy way to truly relax and recharge whenever I have free time.</h4>

					<h4>This is called "Legend of The Female General", which is about He Yan, a noble daughter forced to impersonate her brother, "He Ru Fei," to protect her family's title. After briefly meeting the scholar Xiao Jue, she becomes a war hero but is betrayed by her family. She fakes her death, assumes a new identity, and disguises herself as a man to rejoin the military and seek justice. In the army, she reunites with Xiao Jue, who suspects her of being a spy. As they navigate intense battles and political crises side-by-side, He Yan proves her loyalty, and their initial suspicion gradually evolves into a deep, romantic understanding. <br><br>I liked it so much that I go look up for the novel version of the series and end up liking it even more.
