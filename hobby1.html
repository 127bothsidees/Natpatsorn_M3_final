				<h2>Reading Books: My top 1 favorite hobby!</h2>
				<h4>Reading books is the act of paying attention to written texts-stories, information, or ideas-by sight and contemplation of words on a page. It allows one to delve into new perspectives, learn facts, and understand emotions through characters and events. Reading sharpens the mind, enhances vocabulary, and develops critical thinking. It is not just for entertainment, but also about personal growth, reflection, and connecting with others. <br><br>Reading books is my favourite hobby. I enjoy exploring different worlds and meeting new characters through the pages. It helps me relax after a busy day and sharpens my mind at the same time. I also gain fresh ideas and knowledge which I can use in daily life. For me, reading isn’t just entertainment—it is a way to grow, reflect and imagine more deeply.</h4>
				<h4><br>✧ Then, why reading book is my favorite hobby? <br> I actually don't know when and why do I love reading books. I just remember that I like to read things in my daily life and started reading an actual book when I was in grade 4. Since then, I read so many books and very diverse genre.</h4>

				<h2>My Favorite Book</h2>
				<h4>I like to read many kinds of books but my most favorite genre is <strong>fantasy or romance novel</strong>.</h4>
				<h3>✧ My Favorite book</h3>
				<h4>"Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint," written by singNsong, was first published on January 6, 2018, and concluded on February 2, 2020. The story centers around Kim Dokja, a young office worker who has been reading a web novel titled "Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World" for over a decade. On the day the final chapter is released, the events of the novel begin to unfold in reality, and Dokja becomes the only person aware of how the story will end. Armed with this knowledge, he embarks on a journey to change the fate of the world, facing various challenges and scenarios orchestrated by mythological beings known as dokkaebi.<br>I like this story because the interesting plot, realistic characters background, and the stunning artwork.<br><br> The picture below is the book that i have borrowed from TK park(a library in Central World, which I really love to go). The picture next to the book is TK park's environment.</h4>
